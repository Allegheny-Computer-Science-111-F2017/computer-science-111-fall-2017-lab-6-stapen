# Reflection by Noah Stape

This lab required me to write a file called MaipulateDna. This lab was far
easier than the previous lab because it did not require as much code, meaning
more checkstyle errors. I did not have a problem getting it to run, but
displaying the correct values was a challenge. Remembering the positions of the
string indexes and the many moving parts in this code was difficult. Once I was
able to straighten out all of my various indexes, I was able to figure out how
to properly display the correct string and manipulations of that string. I
enjoyed this lab because it was not overly difficult, but it required
analytical thinking and problem solving.

In conclusion, this lab was enjoyable and rewarding.
